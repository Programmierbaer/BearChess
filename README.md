# BearChess

BearChess is an independent chess GUI for UCI engines with direct support for chess boards (Certabo and Millennium ChessLink).

Why yet another chess GUI?

Many GUIs support electronic chess boards, but do not use the full potential that chess boards with piece recognition offer. They could be much better used for training or analysis of games and positions.

So the focus of BearChess is more on exploiting the possibilities of the chess boards than being just another GUI.
