             <remarks>
             The built-in marshalling subsystem has some behaviors that cannot be changed due to
             backward-compatibility requirements. This attribute allows disabling the built-in
             subsystem and instead uses the following rules for P/Invokes, Delegates,
             and unmanaged function pointer invocations:
            
             - All value types that do not contain reference type fields recursively (<c>unmanaged</c> in C#) are blittable
             - Value types that recursively have any fields that have <c>[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Auto)]</c> are disallowed from interop.
             - All reference types are disallowed from usage in interop scenarios.
             - SetLastError support in P/Invokes is disabled.
             - varargs support is disabled.
             - LCIDConversionAttribute support is disabled.

             </summary>
             <remarks>
             When one or more valid methods
             with this attribute are found in a compilation, the compiler will
             emit a module initializer which calls each of the attributed methods.
            
             Certain requirements are imposed on any method targeted with this attribute:
             - The method must be `static`.
             - The method must be an ordinary member method, as opposed to a property accessor, constructor, local function, etc.
             - The method must be parameterless.
             - The method must return `void`.
             - The method must not be generic or be contained in a generic type.
             - The method's effective accessibility must be `internal` or `public`.

            <remarks>
            This attribute is unsafe because it may reveal uninitialized memory to
            the application in certain instances (e.g., reading from uninitialized
            stackalloc'd memory). If applied to a method directly, the attribute
            applies to that method and all nested functions (lambdas, local
            functions) below it. If applied to a type or module, it applies to all
            methods nested inside. This attribute is intentionally not permitted on
            assemblies. Use at the module level instead to apply to multiple type
            declarations.

        <member name="T:System.Runtime.InteropServices.SuppressGCTransitionAttribute">
             <summary>
             An attribute used to indicate a GC transition should be skipped when making an unmanaged function call.
             </summary>
             <example>
             Example of a valid use case. The Win32 `GetTickCount()` function is a small performance related function
             that reads some global memory and returns the value. In this case, the GC transition overhead is significantly
             more than the memory read.
             <code>
             using System;
             using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
             class Program
             {
                 [DllImport("Kernel32")]
                 [SuppressGCTransition]
                 static extern int GetTickCount();
                 static void Main()
                 {
                     Console.WriteLine($"{GetTickCount()}");
                 }
             }
             </code>
             </example>
             <remarks>
             This attribute is ignored if applied to a method without the <see cref="T:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportAttribute"/>.
            
             Forgoing this transition can yield benefits when the cost of the transition is more than the execution time
             of the unmanaged function. However, avoiding this transition removes some of the guarantees the runtime
             provides through a normal P/Invoke. When exiting the managed runtime to enter an unmanaged function the
             GC must transition from Cooperative mode into Preemptive mode. Full details on these modes can be found at
             https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/coding-guidelines/clr-code-guide.md#2.1.8.
             Suppressing the GC transition is an advanced scenario and should not be done without fully understanding
             potential consequences.
            
             One of these consequences is an impact to Mixed-mode debugging (https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/debugger/how-to-debug-in-mixed-mode).
             During Mixed-mode debugging, it is not possible to step into or set breakpoints in a P/Invoke that
             has been marked with this attribute. A workaround is to switch to native debugging and set a breakpoint in the native function.
             In general, usage of this attribute is not recommended if debugging the P/Invoke is important, for example
             stepping through the native code or diagnosing an exception thrown from the native code.
            
             The runtime may load the native library for method marked with this attribute in advance before the method is called for the first time.
             Usage of this attribute is not recommended for platform neutral libraries with conditional platform specific code.
            
             The P/Invoke method that this attribute is applied to must have all of the following properties:
               * Native function always executes for a trivial amount of time (less than 1 microsecond).
               * Native function does not perform a blocking syscall (e.g. any type of I/O).
               * Native function does not call back into the runtime (e.g. Reverse P/Invoke).
               * Native function does not throw exceptions.
               * Native function does not manipulate locks or other concurrency primitives.
            
             Consequences of invalid uses of this attribute:
               * GC starvation.
               * Immediate runtime termination.
               * Data corruption.

             This attribute is valid on members whose type is <see cref="T:System.Type"/> or <see cref="T:System.String"/>.
            
             When this attribute is applied to a location of type <see cref="T:System.String"/>, the assumption is
             that the string represents a fully qualified type name.
            
             If the attribute is applied to a method it's treated as a special case and it implies
             the attribute should be applied to the "this" parameter of the method. As such the attribute

            <see cref="T:System.Diagnostics.TaskCompletionSource">TaskCompletionSource</see> is provided for this purpose. It enables
            the creation of a task that can be handed out to consumers, and those consumers can use the members
            of the task as they would any other. However, unlike most tasks, the state of a task created by a
            TaskCompletionSource is controlled explicitly by the methods on TaskCompletionSource. This enables the
            completion of the external asynchronous operation to be propagated to the underlying Task. The

            <remarks>
            Users can use this to plug-in custom assertions through C# extension methods.
            For instance, the signature of a custom assertion provider could be "public static void IsOfType&lt;T&gt;(this Assert assert, object obj)"
            Users could then use a syntax similar to the default assertions which in this case is "Assert.That.IsOfType&lt;Dog&gt;(animal);"

            <remarks>
            Users can use this to plug-in custom assertions through C# extension methods.
            For instance, the signature of a custom assertion provider could be "public static void AreEqualUnordered(this CollectionAssert customAssert, ICollection expected, ICollection actual)"
            Users could then use a syntax similar to the default assertions which in this case is "CollectionAssert.That.AreEqualUnordered(list1, list2);"
            More documentation is at "https://github.com/Microsoft/testfx/docs/README.md".

            <remarks>
            Users can use this to plug-in custom assertions through C# extension methods.
            For instance, the signature of a custom assertion provider could be "public static void ContainsWords(this StringAssert customAssert, string value, ICollection substrings)"
            Users could then use a syntax similar to the default assertions which in this case is "StringAssert.That.ContainsWords(value, substrings);"

            <remarks>
            The reason for this attribute is to let the users create their own implementation of test categories.
            - test framework (discovery, etc) deals with TestCategoryBaseAttribute.
            - The reason that TestCategories property is a collection rather than a string,
              is to give more flexibility to the user. For instance the implementation may be based on enums for which the values can be OR'ed
              in which case it makes sense to have single attribute rather than multiple ones on the same test.

            The test method and all the code it calls, must be designed in a way that it observes the cancellation and cancels
            cooperatively. If the test method does not complete, the timeout does not force it to complete.
            When set to <see langword="false"/>, the cancellation token is canceled on timeout, timeout result is reported and the
            method task will continue running on background. This may lead to conflicts in file access on test cleanup, unobserved
            exceptions, and memory leaks.
